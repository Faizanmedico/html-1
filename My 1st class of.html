<p>Learning HTML and CSS is a great start to becoming a web developer. To become an expert, <br>you will need to continue to build on your skills and knowledge. Here are a few tips to help you:<br>
Practice, practice, practice: The more you practice coding, the better you will become. <br>Try building simple websites or recreating websites you like using HTML and CSS.
</p>

<p>Web development is the process of creating <q>websites</q> and web applications using programming languages and tools. Web developers are professionals who specialize in this field and can build various kinds of websites for different purposes.</p>

<p>HTML is a language that consists of multiple short codes are typed into a text document. It has its own grammar and syntax just like any language.
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
Hypertext is the method by which you move around the internet. You click on a link, which is hypertext that directs you from one page to another.
When you write in HTML, you will use a series of tags. These tags tell the text what to do: be italicized, link to another page, be a bulleted point etc.
When you write HTML in a text file, it is then saved as an html file. This file is then opened by a browser, like Google Chrome or Firefox.
Your browser reads the file and translates your code into visual form. That's the website you see.
To utilize HTML, you can use a simple text editor or a powerful HTML editing tool like HTML Kit.
Other programming languages work similarly, but use different syntax and tags. Other languages are available for more complicated types of webpages.
